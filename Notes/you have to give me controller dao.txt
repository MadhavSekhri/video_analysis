you have to give me controller dao and service class separately /n  my api endpoint is updateProfile /n my headers would be "Language
serviceId
" in payload it would take "{
"msisdn":"123123123",
"updatedName":"rahul",
"updatedProfilePic":"1"
}
" /n you have below tasks
1.got to mongo collection profiles_{serviceId} and search document where "msisdn"="msisdn"(from payload)
2. therein we would be getting "displayName" : "ABhi",    "profileImage" : "abhi.jpg"
 these 2 fields dynamic for each user 
3. please note in my api payload I would be getting id only for which i need to first find image name 
4. suppose I got "1" , so I would go to collection named "avatars" /n
its structure is "{
    "_id" : ObjectId("674ffcac02a434218878010e"),
    "serviceId" : "diva-dev.telecubesmobile.com",
    "avatars" : [
        {
            "id" : "1",
            "url" : "avatar1.png"
        },
        {
            "id" : "2",
            "url" : "avatar2.png"
        },
        {
            "id" : "3",
            "url" : "avatar3.png"
        }
    ],
    "language" : "en"
}
" so from here I got avatar1.png
5. I would go to same profiles_{serviceId} and search document where "msisdn"="msisdn"(from payload)
6. I would replace abhi.jpg with avatar1.jpg 
7. I would return response like {
  "status": "success",
 "reason": "Profile Updated Successfully",
 } if it failed I would return {
 "status": "failed",
 "reason": "Oops! Failed to update profile",
 }
8. both the reason responses would be picked like                                String failedMessage = divaDao.getMessageByKey(serviceId, language, "updateProfile.failed-message");
9. also give me mongo doc
