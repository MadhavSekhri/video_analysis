I am building one cms system /n at application level i want you to code in java /n basic task is i am using mongo and i want to maintain a list of operator names along with their serviced along with their status live/ tell me what sturtcure should be of collection also take into consideration like this collection can be driven from cms system /n now give me an api that simply fetches all documents present in collection and returns these fields in response {  

  "operator": "Airtel", 
  "country": "India",
  "serviceId":"airtel_in",

}


{
  "operator": "Airtel", //Name of the operator
  "country": "India",
  "serviceId":"airtel_in",

  "status": "inactive", // Status of the operator (e.g., 'live', 'inactive', etc.)

  "description": "This is one test application for swipe4win via CMS", // Optional

  "metadata": {
    "createdAt": ISODate("2025-01-26T12:00:00Z"), // Timestamp of creation
    "lastUpdatedAt": ISODate("2025-01-27T12:00:00Z") // Timestamp of last update
  }
}

 -------------------------------------------------

Questions:
-old update
-new update



-Return list of operators from application which countries application is live in (or deployed for),Containing
        -Operator and country name
        -ServiceID(short code on which backend configuration made)

-Now at CMS level I have options, where I need to change the content, in both cases for New and existing operators, at the step we must have configuration in Application DB.

-In case of new (it would be created till time via CMS)



-As of now, we have only 2 configuration for cms_demo and cms_staging wherein we are deleting existing questions and updating new

-So, we need to handle below Cases Now:
    -Updating questions dynamically Operator wise (not for fixed 1 opco)
    -Distinguishing whether we are uploading questions/Facts (Option at CMS)
    -Giving an Option at CMS whether we are replacing existing questions (remove existing & upload new) or we need to just add questions -RESET_OPERATOR
    -Configuring Set-Length (As some operators have 5 setLength, some have setLength of 10 or more)
    -An extra parameter "Backup", keeping initially TRUE for all, this would simply take existing questions(configuration) backup at application level
    -An extra parameter "pushLive", keeping initially TRUE for all, not much need as we would be having separate staging and live configurations(still taking)

2 APIS

1. LIVE
  -PUSH TO LIVE OPERATOR
2. STAGING
  -ALWAYS PUSH TO CMS DEMO



1. LIVE 

CMS -> S4W [FETCH OPERATORS_LIST API]
S4W -> RETURN LIST TO CMS

CMS -> S4W [API TO UPDATE QUESTIONS (WITH SHELL)]
S4W -> CONFIRM CMS
